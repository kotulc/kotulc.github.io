# Visualizations

The goal of this project is to create a convienent framework for combining and animating matplotlib components concurrently. The product is akin to a dashboard with the single purpose of displaying multiple plots, each with many different sources of sequential information. Component subplots may be updated on a step or sub-step schedule, meaning that select subplots can display information at different rates or resolutions. The sub-step animation support provides an additional layer of flexibilty when displaying sequential data that may have been collected at different intervals. For more information please see the project wiki page.
